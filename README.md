# AlAmeen

A program that manages all your personal finances, allows you to set budgeting
goals and helps you achieve them.

## Documentation

Most of the documentation can be found in the `docs/` directory, UI prototypes
are on figma and therefore not present here.

### Design

#### Model

For now, the program uses the repository design pattern for the back-end, which
allows me to segregate and partition different objects of interest into their
own respective classes

## Roadmap

I will try to get as much code through as I can, but due to work and school, I
estimate this project to complete by the end of this summer
